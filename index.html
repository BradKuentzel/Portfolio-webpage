    <div id="content">
      <p>I'm a software developer currently living in sunny Venice, Florida.</p>
      <p>I have developed a passion for coding seeking a way to fulfill another passion of mine which is traveling. I was looking for a new career path that would allow me to travel the country with my family so I started searching and found <a href="Thinkful.com">Thinkful!</a> I fell in love with the constant challenges and problem solving that their Software Engineering Immersion precourse was offering me. I've always strived in challenging enviornments so coding has become a lifesaver for me and I'm super excited what this next chapter in my life will bring.</p>
      <p>Take a look at my web page. If you want to say hi or even talk about coding <a href="#contact">contact me anytime!</a></p>
